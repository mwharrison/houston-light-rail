### Description
Subway Map Visualization Reloaded is heir to [Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin](http://www.kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/) that brings compatability with IE7+ browsers (if you may call it a 'browser'). SMVR uses [excanvas.js](http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/) to render `<canvas>` in outdated browsers. Few minor fixes are also provided:
- Markers are drawn accordingly to it's line color;
- Some wrong mistypes are corrected to the right mistypos.
